# OpenFoodFacts_-ContributorAnalysis

Project for OpenFoodFacts.

The goal was to create a system that would allow to understand the habits of use of contributors to OFF.

Created a Python script that would run every week or so, collect and treat data from the huge OFF database.

Intermediate collections would be fed to the database and used in a grafana script to show some visualisations.

We also used clustering to try and distinguish different types of users.
